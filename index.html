                Don't end up like that family over there! Crying because their cookies are circles.<br>
                <---<br>
                Are you tired of boring, round cookies? Do you find yourself wishing for a treat that's as whimsically weird as it is delicious? Well, have we got the <s>harebrained</s> fin-tastic business venture for you! Welcome to the delightfully absurd world of Salmon Shaped Cookies Inc., where our cookies aren't as flaky as fish but do crumble faster than your faith in conventional <s>capitalism</s> confectioneries.
                <br><br>             
                Yes, the idea is as fishy as it sounds. You might think, "Cookies shaped like fish? That's ridiculous!" And you'd be absolutely right! But isn't life too short for plain, old circle cookies and sound financial decisions?
                <br><br>
                As a franchisee of Salmon Shaped Cookies Inc., you'll be swimming upstream in the culinary world, leaving the boring biscotti and commonplace cookies in your wake. And don't worry about riding this wave alone. We're with you every step of the way, providing you with all the training you'll need to convincingly explain why cookies should look like a salmon.
                <br><br>
                You might ask, "Are these cookies made with real salmon?" Absolutely not! But they could be... idk.
                <br><br>
                We're the dreamers who dared to wonder what a fish-shaped cookie might taste like, and the brave souls who found out it tastes just like a regular cookie (but way funnier).
                <br><br>
                So get roe-ing in here (ok--that one was bad) to be part of the least logical, most hilarious bakery concept of the century: Salmon Shaped Cookies Inc. It's a truly 'fin-tastic' opportunity!
